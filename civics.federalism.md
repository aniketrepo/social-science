1. Federalism is derived from the Latin word *"foedus"* which means a compact or agreement.

2. **Federalsim** refers to the mixed or compound mode of government, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments (provincial, state, *Land* territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system.

3. Some different countries using federal form of government are:
* Canada
* USA
* Brazil
* Russia
* Australia
* India

4. Features of federalism:
* There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.
* Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own JURISDICTION in specific matters of legeslation, taxation and administration.
* The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.
* The fundemental provisions of the constitutions cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government.
* Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.
* Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure its financial autonomy.
* The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity.

5. Difference between Unitary System and Federal System:

|Unitary System|Federal System|
|--------------|--------------|
|There is only one level of government or the sub-units are coordinate to the central government.  The central government can pass orders on the provincial or the local government.|The central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own  for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are seperately answerable to the people.

6. *What makes India a federal country?*

-> Indian government is divided into three levels:
* Central Government- A central government is the government that is a controlling power over a unitary state. Essentially, the central government has the power to make laws for the whole country, in contrast with local governments.
* State Government- A state government is the government of a country subdivision in a federal form of government, which shares political power with the federal or national government. A state government may have some level of political autonomy, or be subject to the direct control of the federal government.
* Panchayat and Municipalities- Panchayats and municipalities are government organisations that are established by the State governments, and which manage all the affairs of the area in which they are located.

7. The constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism.

8. The constitution clearly provided a threefold distribution of legeslative powers between the Union Goverment and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists:

|Union List|State List|Concurrent List|
|----------|----------|---------------|
|Has subjects of National importance.|Has subjects of local and State importance.|Has subjects of common interests both to Centre and State.|
|Union alone can make laws.|State Government alone can make laws.|Both the Centre and State can frame laws.|
|Defence, Banking, Currency, Foreign affairs and communication.|Police, Trade, Commerce, Agriculture and Irrigation.|Education, Forest, Trade Union, Marriage, Adoption and succession.|

9. *What about the subjects that do not fall in any of the three lists?*

-> According to our constitution the Union Government has the power to legeslate on these 'residuary' subjects.
