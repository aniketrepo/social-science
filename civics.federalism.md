1. Federalism is derived from the Latin word *"foedus"* which means a compact or agreement.

2. **Federalsim** refers to the mixed or compound mode of government, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments (provincial, state, *Land* territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system.

3. Some different countries using federal form of government are:
* Canada
* USA
* Brazil
* Russia
* Australia
* India

4. Features of federalism:
* There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.
* Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own JURISDICTION in specific matters of legeslation, taxation and administration.
* The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.
* The fundemental provisions of the constitutions cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government.
* Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.
* Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure its financial autonomy.
* The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity.

5. Difference between Unitary System and Federal System:

|Unitary System|Federal System|
|--------------|--------------|
|There is only one level of government or the sub-units are coordinate to the central government.  The central government can pass orders on the provincial or the local government.|The central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own  for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are seperately answerable to the people.

6. *What makes India a federal country?*

-> Indian government is divided into three levels:
* Central Government- A central government is the government that is a controlling power over a unitary state. Essentially, the central government has the power to make laws for the whole country, in contrast with local governments.
* State Government- A state government is the government of a country subdivision in a federal form of government, which shares political power with the federal or national government. A state government may have some level of political autonomy, or be subject to the direct control of the federal government.
* Panchayat and Municipalities- Panchayats and municipalities are government organisations that are established by the State governments, and which manage all the affairs of the area in which they are located.

7. The constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism.

8. The constitution clearly provided a threefold distribution of legeslative powers between the Union Goverment and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists:

|Union List|State List|Concurrent List|
|----------|----------|---------------|
|Has subjects of National importance.|Has subjects of local and State importance.|Has subjects of common interests both to Centre and State.|
|Union alone can make laws.|State Government alone can make laws.|Both the Centre and State can frame laws.|
|Defence, Banking, Currency, Foreign affairs and communication.|Police, Trade, Commerce, Agriculture and Irrigation.|Education, Forest, Trade Union, Marriage, Adoption and succession.|

9. *What about the subjects that do not fall in any of the three lists?*

-> According to our constitution the Union Government has the power to legeslate on these 'residuary' subjects.

10. Different routes to federalism:
* The First Route - Coming Together federations, USA, Switzerland, Australia
* The Second Route - Holding together federations, India, Spain, Belgium

11. The First Route:
* Coming together federation involves independent states coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty (holding a supereme, indipendent authority over a region or state) and retaining identity they can increase their security.
* This type of 'coming together' federations include USA, Switzerland and Australia.
* In this first category of federations, all the constituent states usually have equal power.

12. The Second Route:
* Holding together federations where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government.
* In this second category, the national government tends to be more powerful.
* Very often different constituent units of federation have unequal powers.

13. *How is federalism practiced?*

-> Democratic politics in our country ensured that the spirit of federalism, respect for diversity and desire for living together became a shared ideal in our country. Let us look at some of the major ways in which this happend:
* Linguistic States- The creation of linguistic states was the first and the major test for the democratics politics in our country. This was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same state. Some states were created not on the basis of language but to recognise the differences based on culture, ethnicity or geography. For e.g. Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.
* Language Policy- A second test for Indian federation is the language policy. Our constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language. Hindi was identified as the national language. But, Hindi is only the mother tongue of only about 40% of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages. Besides Hindi, there are 21 other languages recognised as Scheduled Languages by the constitution. Hindi was not imposed on non-Hindi areas for most of the period after independence.
* Center-State Relations- Restructing the centre-state relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthend in practice.
