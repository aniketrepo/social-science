1. Situation before emergence of MNCs
* Till mid 20th century, production was largely organised within countries.
* Colonies such as India exported raw materials & food stuff and imported finished goods.
* Trade was the main channel which was connecting distant countries.

2. What are MNCs?
* Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are companies which own or control production in more than one nation.
* Sets up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour & other resources.
* Aim- Low cost of production and greater profits.

3. Conditions required to setup MNCs
* Closeness to markets.
* Cheap skilled and unskilled labour.
* Favourable government policies.

Having assured themselves of these conditions, MNCs setup factories and offices for production.

4. Investment- The money that is spent to buy assets such as land, buildings, machines, and other equipment is called investment. 

5. Foreign Investment- Investment made by MNCs is called Foreign Investment.

6. Interlinking production across countries-
* Sometimes, MNCs setup production jointly with some of the local companies of a country. Benifits to local companies of joint production-
     * MNCs provide money for additional investments, like buying new machines for faster production.
     * MNCs might bring them the latest technology for production.

* Most common route for MNCs is investment to buy up local compaines & expand their production. Wealthy MNCs can do this easily.
* Another way in which MNCs control production-
     * Large MNCs place their orders for production with small producers & sell them under their brand name.
     * These MNCs have tremendous powers to determine price, quality, delivery, & labour conditions for these distant producers.

* **Conclusion**
     * MNCs are exerting a strong influence on production at these distant locations.
     * Result- production in these widely dispersed locations is getting interlinked.
