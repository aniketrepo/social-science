1. Situation before emergence of MNCs
* Till mid 20th century, production was largely organised within countries.
* Colonies such as India exported raw materials & food stuff and imported finished goods.
* Trade was the main channel which was connecting distant countries.

2. What are MNCs?
* Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are companies which own or control production in more than one nation.
* Sets up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour & other resources.
* Aim- Low cost of production and greater profits.

3. Conditions required to setup MNCs
* Closeness to markets.
* Cheap skilled and unskilled labour.
* Favourable government policies.

Having assured themselves of these conditions, MNCs setup factories and offices for production.

4. Investment- The money that is spent to buy assets such as land, buildings, machines, and other equipment is called investment. 

5. Foreign Investment- Investment made by MNCs is called Foreign Investment.

6. Interlinking production across countries-
* Sometimes, MNCs setup production jointly with some of the local companies of a country. Benifits to local companies of joint production-
     * MNCs provide money for additional investments, like buying new machines for faster production.
     * MNCs might bring them the latest technology for production.

* Most common route for MNCs is investment to buy up local compaines & expand their production. Wealthy MNCs can do this easily.
* Another way in which MNCs control production-
     * Large MNCs place their orders for production with small producers & sell them under their brand name.
     * These MNCs have tremendous powers to determine price, quality, delivery, & labour conditions for these distant producers.
* **Conclusion**
     * MNCs are exerting a strong influence on production at these distant locations.
     * Result- production in these widely dispersed locations is getting interlinked.

7. Foreign trade integration of markets
* Foreign Trade- It is the exchange of capital, goods and services across international borders or territories.
* Basic functions of foreign trade-
     * Provides vast market to producers.
     * For buyers, import of goods produced in another country is one way of expanding the choice of goods.
* **Conclusion**
     * With the opening of trade, goods travel from one market to another.
     * Choice of goods in the market increases.
     * Prices of similar goods in two markets tend to become equal.
     * Increased competition between producers of two different counteries.
* Foreign trade thus results in connecting the markets or integration of markets in different countries.

8. What is Globalisation?
* It is the process of rapid integration or interconnection between countries.
* MNCs play a major role in the globalisation process.
* More & more goods and services, investments & technology are moving between countries.
* Large part of foreign trade controled by MNCs.
* Result- greater integration of production & markets across counteries.
* Their is another way in which countries can be connected. This is through movement of people. However due to various restrictions there has not been much increase in the movement of people between counteries.
